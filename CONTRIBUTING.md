## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI coding tools may be used to prepare contributions, under these conditions:

1. **Disclose it.** A commit containing substantial AI-generated code or text
   carries a trailer naming the tool, for example
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Alternatively, state in the
   pull request which parts were AI-assisted and with which tool.
2. **The human submitter is responsible.** You must understand, review, and test
   every line you submit. "The tool wrote it" is not a justification in review,
   and AI-assisted changes meet the same review bar as any other change.
3. **Security-sensitive changes need failure-path tests.** Changes to
   the installer, package signing, or the publishing workflow must include
   negative tests alongside the success path.
4. **Never share secrets with AI tools.** Do not paste credentials, private keys,
   enrollment tokens, or non-public endpoint data into prompts.
